# MailList
This Website was created during the MLH (Major League Hacking) at WPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
A Webapp that helps to sync TechSync members and Mailinglist by taking them as input and then outputing the diff. It also combines to Maillists and gets rid of duplicates.

The website is currently being hosted at users.wpi.edu/~bkayastha/Maillist/MailSync and users.wpi.edu/~bkayastha/Maillist/MailCombine
